    <h1>Solar new years 2020+1</h1>

    <p>Becuz 'rona, it's online.
        Willy Gibson called and wants their plot back.
        Seriously, they even turned the launch of a cyberpunk-themed video 
        game into a satire of corporate alienation.
        But Jeff Bezos owns the rights and wants to branch into 
        reality-life-streaming, so we're stuck. 
        Well, might as well ... </p>

    <p> Join us in the above green box linked series of tubes,
        on the evening of the 31st, so Thursday night.
        Let's say 2000 Pacific time, 2300 Eastern.
        Feel free to join at any time before then to check out the space.
        </p>

    <p>The green button is a link to 
        <a href="https://workadventu.re">Workadventu.re</a>
        running a custom map. 
        <strike>Inspired by</strike> Copied from
        <a href="https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/raw.githubusercontent.com/chaosz0ne/shared/main/main.json">
        the CCCd3 conference map</a>, like I downloaded their tiles here.
        And if anyone knows german, please let me know what
        <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/ds20-11331-einfuhrung_remote_datenspuren#t=9">they are saying</a>.
        </p>

    <p>All are welcome, but don't broadcast it. Cuz I expect bomber kid crews
        are on their A game for NYE (mad respect, but just trying to dodge it).
        </p>

    <h3>README how to</h3>
    <p>WorkAdventure is a hilarious name for a program/system made 
        by "TheCodingMachine". I think they're a French company, but the 
        software is an open-source proximity video/audio chat tool. 
        It uses a browser game engine with open-source tile map format 
        to render the 2D space, 
        then routes video chat through the main Jitsi server.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You join the link, enter a name, pick or make an avatar, then join.
            </li>
        <li>You can then walk around with arrow keys or WADS.
            Control video/audio/screen-share with buttons on lower right.
            </li>
        <li>IF ANYTHING FAILS or if it just goes black, you can always just
            reload the same URL and you'll get back fine. </li>
        <li>If you're near other people, it'll show you video, circle of
            listening, and a text chat on the left. </li>
        <li>Different areas trigger different things. Near the fires it 
            launches a Jitsi meet for people in that area. 
            People who are not on the map can join these (I think),
            they are meet.jit.si meetings at 
            <ul>
<a href='https://meet.jit.si/long-name-circleA'><li>long-name-circleA</li></a>
<a href='https://meet.jit.si/long-name-circleB'><li>long-name-circleB</li></a>
<a href='https://meet.jit.si/long-name-circleC'><li>long-name-circleC</li></a>
<a href='https://meet.jit.si/long-name-circleD'><li>long-name-circleD</li></a>
            </ul>
            Which one's which? Good question.
        <li>Near the computers it opens a website for playing a drawing game
            with an AI, and below it is one with other humans.
            Up top are some etherpad boards at the kiosk and grave stone.
            </li>
        <li>Up top there's a cave that exits to another room with a few 
            things, may put more in there later.
            </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Help welcome</h3>
    <p>Have ideas for the map? Please let darachm know.</p>
    <p>Editing the map is easy with
        <a href="https://workadventu.re/create-map.html">this guide</a>.
        Just lemme know if you have any good ideas and I can try to 
        implement it. 
        We're limited to non-animated tiles and whatever can open in 
        an iframe. But more webgames/weird(ish) links could be good.
        </p>

    <p>Github repo hosting the map is 
        <a href="https://github.com/darachm/end-of-now">here</a>,
        so feel free to use the above guide to edit it and host it on github.
        </p>
