    <p>Becuz 'rona, it's online.
        Willy Gibson called and wants their plot back.
        Seriously, they even turned the launch of a cyberpunk-themed video 
        game into a satire of corporate alienation.
        But Jeff Bezos owns the rights and wants to branch into 
        reality-life-streaming, so we're stuck. 
        Well, might as well ... </p>

    <h3>README how to</h3>
    <p>WorkAdventure is a hilarious name for a program/system made 
        by "TheCodingMachine". 
        It's an open-source proximity video/audio chat tool. 
        It uses a browser game engine with open-source tile map format 
        to render the 2D space, 
        then routes video chat through the main Jitsi server.
        </p>
    <p><Strong>To join :</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go use the above green link/URL and go there.
            Enter a name, pick or make an avatar, then join.
            </li>
        <li>You can then walk around with arrow keys or WADS.
            Control video/audio/screen-share with buttons on lower right.
            You can zoom out with the browser to see more of the map.
            Other controls pop up when you're near other characters/avatars.
            </li>
        <li>If you're near other people, it'll show you video, circle of
            listening, and a text chat on the left. </li>
        <li>IF ANYTHING FAILS or if it just goes black, you can always just
            reload the same URL and you'll get back fine. 
            F5 is your friend.</li>
        <li>Different areas trigger different things. Near the fires it 
            launches a Jitsi meet for people in that area. 
            People who are not on the map can join these (I think),
            they are meet.jit.si meetings at 
            <ul>

            <strong>I have no idea if smartphones can whole map,</strong>
            but joining the above links with a smartphone should work.
            </li>
        <li>Some areas will open up a web panel on your right, with games or
            a livestream of puppies. The bulletin boards at top are etherpads.
            To exit these, click onto the map and try the WADS/arrow keys.
            If that doesn't work, click the X in the top right of the 
            web panel and hit Escape. Or just refresh the page.
            </li>
        <li>Up top there's a cave that exits to another room.
            May put more stuff in there later.
            </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Help welcome</h3>
    <p>Have ideas for the map? Please let darachm know.</p>
    <p>Editing the map is easy with
        <a href="https://workadventu.re/create-map.html">this guide</a>.
        Just lemme know if you have any good ideas and I can try to 
        implement it. 
        We're limited to non-animated tiles and whatever can open in 
        an iframe. But more webgames/weird(ish) links could be good.
        </p>

    <p>Github repo hosting the map is 
        <a href="https://github.com/darachm/end-of-now">here</a>,
        so feel free to use the above guide to edit it and host it on github.
        </p>
